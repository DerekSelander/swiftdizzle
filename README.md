# swiftdizzle
Swift method swizzling/method introspection for Swift instance methods

Why should Objective-C's method Swizzling or C's DYLD interpose, or C's lazy stubs `__DATA.__la_symbol_ptr` get all the introspection fun? **swiftdizzle** is a nice little C function that can intrpsoect pure Swift functions at runtime.
